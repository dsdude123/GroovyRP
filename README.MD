# GroovyRP
Groove Music Rich Presence for Discord
## System Requirements:

* Windows 10 version 1809 or newer
* Microsoft Music Player
* .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer
* Discord (desktop client only)
## How to Use:

* Download the latest release of GroovyRP https://github.com/dsdude123/GroovyRP/releases/latest
* Extract GroovyRP.zip.
* Run GroovyRP.exe.

## Changes since last version:

* Add support for the new media player that replaced Groove Music. This program no longer works with the original Groove Music and users with that player still installed should not update. 
* Disabled auto-start support. Unfortunately, the new media player does not generate events necessary to trigger GroovyRP to automatically start.
